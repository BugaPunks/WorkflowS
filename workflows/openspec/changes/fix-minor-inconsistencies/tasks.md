# Change: Fix Minor Inconsistencies - Code Cleanup and Polish

## Why
While the major architectural issues have been resolved, there are still minor inconsistencies in code comments, variable naming, and pending TODOs that affect code quality and maintainability. These small issues accumulate and make the codebase harder to understand and maintain over time.

## What Changes
- **REMOVED**: All pending TODO comments that have been implemented
- **MODIFIED**: Variable names for better consistency and clarity
- **MODIFIED**: Code comments translated to Spanish for consistency
- **CLEANED**: Unused imports and variables
- **STANDARDIZED**: Naming conventions across the codebase

## Impact
- Affected specs: Code quality and maintainability improvements
- Affected code: Variable names, comments, and code structure across multiple files
- Breaking changes: None - internal code improvements only</content>

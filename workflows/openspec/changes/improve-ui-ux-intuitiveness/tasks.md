# Change: Improve UI/UX Intuitiveness and Views

## Why
The WorkflowS platform has all required functionality implemented, but the user interface could be more intuitive and visually appealing, similar to modern tools like Trello and Teams. The current views are functional but lack visual polish, better navigation, and comprehensive project overviews that would make the platform feel more complete and user-friendly for academic project management.

## What Changes
- **ADDED**: Project overview dashboard with timeline, team status, and key metrics
- **ADDED**: Enhanced calendar view with sprint planning and deadline visualization
- **ADDED**: Team collaboration view showing members, roles, and activity
- **ADDED**: Global search functionality across projects, tasks, and users
- **ADDED**: Improved sidebar navigation with quick access and role-based sections
- **ADDED**: Notification center with filtering and read/unread management
- **MODIFIED**: Enhanced responsive design for mobile and tablet usage
- **MODIFIED**: Added dark mode toggle for better user experience
- **MODIFIED**: Improved visual design with better spacing, colors, and icons
- **ADDED**: Welcome/tutorial tooltips for new users

## Impact
- Affected specs: New capabilities for project-overview, team-view, search, enhanced-navigation
- Affected code: New components for overview pages, enhanced existing components with better styling
- Breaking changes: None - UI improvements only</content>

# Change: Add Frontend Component Tests

## Why
The project has comprehensive API tests but lacks frontend component tests for the new UI features. While the backend functionality is well-tested, frontend components should also have basic tests to ensure UI consistency and prevent regressions in user interactions.

## What Changes
- **ADDED**: Basic component tests for new UI features
- **ADDED**: Test setup for React components with Next.js
- **ADDED**: Mocks for Next.js hooks and external dependencies
- **FOCUSED**: Tests for critical user-facing components only

## Impact
- Affected specs: New test files for frontend components
- Affected code: Test configuration and component test files
- Breaking changes: None - new tests only</content>
